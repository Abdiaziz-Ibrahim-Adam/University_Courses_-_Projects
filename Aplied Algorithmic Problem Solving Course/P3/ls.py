* ls - File Lister

    This program filters a list of filenames based on a given pattern that 
    includes wildcard characters ('*'). The wildcard '*' matches 
    zero or more characters of any kind.

* Solution Approach:
    1. Read the pattern `P` and the list of filenames.
    2. Split the pattern using `*`  to separate parts of a string so that we can get substrings .
    3. Then I ensure that the filename contains these substrings in the correct order:
       - If the pattern does not start with `*`, the filename must start with the first substring.
       - If the pattern does not end with `*`, the filename must end with the last substring.
       - All other substrings must appear in order, even if separated by other characters.
    4. Using `.find()` to check if each substring appears in sequence within the filename.

* Time Complexity:
    - Splitting the pattern into substrings: O(m) , with `m` being the length of the pattern.
    - Searching for each substring in a filename: O(n)
    - Checking all `N` filenames results in O(N * n) complexity. N represents the number of filenames in the input.
    n represents the length of the longest filename
    - Total Complexity: O(N * n)
