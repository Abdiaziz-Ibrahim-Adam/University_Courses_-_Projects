* Robot Tour Optimization â€“ Nearest Neighbor Heuristic *

This program implements a heuristic solution to the problem where a robotic arm must visit a series of 
points on a circuit board in an optimized order. The problem is a variation of the classic 
"Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)," where we aim to find the shortest cyclic tour that visits each 
point exactly once.

* Solution Approach: *
1. Reading Input from Standard Input (sys.stdin)
   - The program expects a list of points in the plane where:
     - Lines starting with `#` are ignored as comments.
     - The first relevant line specifies the number of points.
     - The following lines contain `(x, y)` coordinates as integer values.
     ```

2. Implementing the Nearest-Neighbor Heuristic
   - The algorithm selects a starting point (the first point in the input list).
   - It iteratively selects the nearest unvisited point and adds it to the tour.
   - The process repeats until all points are visited.
   - Finally, it returns to the starting point to complete the cycle.

3. Calculating Distances:
   - The program computes the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`:
     ```
     d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
     ```
   - This helps determine which point is closest at each step.

4. Generating the Output
   - The computed tour is printed in the required format:
     - First line: The number of points.
     - Following lines: `(x, y)` coordinates in visit order.
