"""
* Robot Tour Optimization â€“ Closest Pair Heuristic *

This program implements the Closest-Pair Heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Instead of always choosing the nearest neighbor, it iteratively merges the closest available pairs
of points until a full cycle is formed.

* Solution Approach: *
1. Reading Input from Standard Input (sys.stdin)
   - The program expects a list of points (x, y) in the plane.
   - Lines starting with `#` are ignored as comments.
   - The first relevant line specifies the number of points.
   - The following lines contain `(x, y)` coordinates.

2. Initializing Chains
   - Each point starts as its own separate chain.
   - A priority queue (min-heap) is used to efficiently store and retrieve the closest pairs.

3. Merging Closest Pairs
   - The algorithm repeatedly finds the closest pair of endpoints.
   - It merges them into a single chain.
   - The process continues until only one cycle remains.

4. Finalizing the Tour
   - The last two endpoints are connected to form a cycle.
   - The result is printed in the required format.
