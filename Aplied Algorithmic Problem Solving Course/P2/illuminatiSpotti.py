"""
Illuminati Spotti - Counting Triangles in an Undirected Graph

### How the program solves the problem:
1. Read the adjacency matrix representing the graph.
2. Iterate through all possible triplets (i, j, k) where i < j < k.
3. Check if all three cities are directly connected to form a triangle.
4. Count and output the total number of triangles found.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through all unique triplets (i, j, k), which results in O(nÂ³) complexity.
